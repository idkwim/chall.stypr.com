                            Welcome to Stereotyped Challenges!<br><br>
                            This website provides several advanced web hack challenges, which would require you to think and solve logically. I recommend you to try <a href="http://webhacking.kr">webhacking.kr</a> and <a href="http://wargame.kr">wargame.kr</a> beforehand. <br><br>

                            The rules of this website are simple &mdash; Make sure that other users can enjoy my challenges. DO NOT bruteforce challenges and DO NOT post your solutions on the internet. Challenges would become so boring and useless if things are posted everywhere.
