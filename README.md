# Stereotyped Challenges

Developed by stypr. Feel free to use the framework.

Tested on php5.4/nginx-stable/mariadb10/debian_x86 and php5.6/nginx-dev/mysql55/win2012srv_x64.

Since the template files are extremely dirty, it iss better to use the code as a reference and re-implement everything again.
